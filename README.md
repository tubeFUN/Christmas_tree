Christmas tree prepared for a child's school Christmas market
## Inspiration
Once a year, a Christmas market is organized at the child's school, for which children and parents prepare Christmas decorations. Money collected from the sale of decorations is used to retrofit the school. Last year I made an "analog" Christmas tree, composed of components related to electronics. This year I plan to make a Christmas tree in a "digital" spirit.
